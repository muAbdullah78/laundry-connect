# Ownership Transfer Guide for LaundryConnect

This document provides instructions for taking full ownership of the LaundryConnect platform.

## GitHub Repository Setup

To take ownership of the code repository:

1. Log in to your GitHub account (muAbdullah78)
2. Create a new repository named "laundry-connect"
3. Make it private if you want to keep the code confidential
4. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license

## Uploading the Code

Since the code is already prepared with Git, you can upload it to your repository:

1. Download the complete codebase from the provided source
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in the downloaded directory
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/muAbdullah78/laundry-connect.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

To take ownership of the Vercel deployment:

1. Create a Vercel account using your email (muabdullah9987@gmail.com)
2. Follow the steps in the DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md file to deploy the project
3. This will automatically make you the owner of the deployment

## Admin Access Setup

1. During the first deployment, an admin account will be created
2. Use your email (muabdullah9987@gmail.com) as the admin email

3. Configure DNS settings according to Vercel's instructions

## Backup and Security

As the owner, you should:

1. Regularly back up your database
